Fish's Revenger, where you play as the Bear and many different fish chase you down in the location of space. If the fish get you 
then it is automatically "Game Over", there are no three lives where i wish i could have figured that out. The game funcioned very
and through the process of making the game I learned alot of what coding is and what coding a game is like, all the different types
of games there are would not work without the power of coding. In my game there was a bug where "Game Over" would pop up once you hit
the run button after you have already played. Making this game was quite stressful but in the end watching your game work was the best
feeling.
